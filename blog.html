    <h2>📚 First-Time Novelist, Full-Time Chaos Gremlin</h2>
    <p><strong>Hi, reader friends 👋</strong></p>
    <p>So… this is my first-ever blog post. Not just as an author—like, ever. And somehow, I get to say I’m officially a published author. (Cue dramatic gasp, coffee chugging, and a slight identity crisis.)</p>
    <p>This week, I released my debut novel, <em>Twin Flame</em>, into the world. What started as a mess of late-night notes, emotionally loaded daydreams, and characters that refused to let me sleep is now a real book. On shelves. In Kindles. Hopefully living rent-free in a few hearts, too.</p>
    <p>Writing this story was emotional, chaotic, and incredibly personal. I didn’t just create a romance—I wrote survival. Transformation. A love that burns everything down and still dares to rise. If you’ve picked it up already, thank you. Truly. And if you’re just here to see what kind of person calls their blog post “chaos gremlin,” welcome. You’re my kind of human.</p>
    
    <h3>🖤 What You’ll Find Here</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Behind-the-scenes writing chaos</li>
      <li>Character deep-dives and inspiration</li>
      <li>Updates on current projects</li>
      <li>Sneak peeks (aka: soft spoilers)</li>
      <li>Occasional spirals over fictional heartbreak</li>
      <li>And caffeine-fueled thoughts on all things bookish</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Basically, it’s organized emotional damage—with a playlist and some feelings.</p>

    <h3>💬 Let’s Be Friends</h3>
    <p>Whether you're a dark romance reader, a fellow writer, or just here for the vibes—I’d love to hear from you. Leave a comment, scream with me about <em>Twin Flame</em>, or drop a quick “hi” and make my day.</p>
    <p>Thanks for being here at the start of something that means the world to me. I have so many stories left to tell, and this is only the beginning.</p>
    <p><strong>With love, fire, and probably too many feelings,<br>
